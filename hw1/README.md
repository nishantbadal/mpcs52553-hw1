### Challenge #1 [not graded]

 Install the following Chrome extensions.  They will help you throughout the course.

 * ColorZilla
 * Web Developer
 * WhatFont


### Challenge #2 [not graded]

 Take the database self-test, `db_self_test.pdf`.  If you don't think you can answer all of the questions, please make an appointment with Ben Block as soon as possible.

### Challenge #3: Valid HTML 5 documents [1 point]

1. Open `make_valid.html` in Chrome.  Notice that Chrome can display it even though it isn't a strictly valid HTML5 document.
2. Use the [HTML5 Validation Service](https://html5.validator.nu) to upload the file and check it for validation errors.
3. Modify the file and re-check the file until no errors remain.

Here is a screenshot of how to use the service on a local file:

### Challenge #4: Understanding Stylesheet Cascades [2 points]

1. Open `make_nice.html` in Chrome.  Compare with [already_nice.png](already_nice.png)
2. See [nice_specs.png](nice_specs.png) for detailed requirements.
3. Put your style rules in `make_nice.css`.  
  - You can modify `make_nice.html` all you want
  - But you may _not_ use a `<style>` element anywhere in the HTML


### Challenge #5: Using the Bootstrap Grid [2 points]

1. Browse to https://www.jeffcohenonline.com/hw1
2. Follow the instructions you see there. (Hint: the content of the page is fine, but the layout is wrong).
3. When you're done, you should have a valid HTML5 document named `grid.html` as part of your repository.
